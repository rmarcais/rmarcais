## Hi there :wave:
### My story :open_book:

- Hello ! My name's Rémi Marçais and I'm currently a student in Holberton School LAVAL. I'd be finishing my studies in 3 months and I'm looking for an internship in Web Development or in Machine Learning because I'm really interested by creating application containing IA.

- During my first year at Holberton, I worked mainly in C language, Python and bash scripting. Thus I'm comfortable with these languages and especially with web development in Pyhton. Indeed, I worked on different projects using Python3, MySql and Flask as a web framework and this is why I'm looking for an opportunity to deepen my knowledges in WebDev or Machine Learning.

- I recreated the printf function, a simple version of the Linux Shell and cloned the AirBnB website (throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimester) with three different groups. Thanks to the school learning approach we learned to work collaboratively, in person and remotely.
